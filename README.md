# JumpBlitz

JumpBlitz is an exciting Pygame-based game where players control a character who must escape from approaching snails by jumping. The objective is to survive as long as possible by timing your jumps correctly.

## Gameplay

- The player's character is located at the bottom of the screen.
- Snails will appear at regular intervals from the top of the screen, descending towards the player.
- The player can control their character's jumps by pressing the space bar. Releasing the space bar makes the character descend.
- The player must time their jumps carefully to avoid colliding with the snails.
- The game continues until the player's character collides with a snail or reaches a high-score milestone.

## Features

- Responsive and intuitive controls using the space bar for jumping.
- Increasing level of difficulty as the game progresses.
- Score tracking to keep a record of the player's performance.
- Simple yet engaging graphics and animations built using Pygame.

## Prerequisites
